# Topic Modeling
#
# This project applies and compares two foundational topic modeling techniques - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) - on a large corpus of over 1.8 million news articles from the New York Times spanning 1987 to 2007. The aims are to discover the salient topics automatically extracted from this real-world dataset using LDA and LSA, and to evaluate the relative strengths, limitations, and differences between the two models. Key steps include data preprocessing, model training and tuning, topic induction, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of the induced topics. The results provide insights into how unsupervised topic modeling can surface themantic themes in massive textual corpora like news archives.
